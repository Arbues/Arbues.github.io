## Research Publications

### 1. A Hybrid Agronomic and Economic Recommendation System for Potato Variety Selection in Peru

**Authors:** Arbués E. Pérez Villegas, Sergio S. Pezo Jimenez, Ernesto Olivares Aspillaga, Max D. de la Cruz Barbarón, Luis A. Romero Valle  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Status:** SSRN Preprint, Under Review for Journal Publication  
**Link:** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5501140

**Abstract:**  
Novel hybrid recommendation system that addresses the gap in potato variety selection decision-support tools. The system fuses two key components: (1) a neural network model that predicts an "ideal feature vector" from climatic, geophysical, and phytosanitary variables, and (2) SARIMA models trained to forecast monthly demand for 11 commercial potato groups. System achieved 82.4% accuracy and reduced analysis time by 30% compared to traditional methods.

**Key Technologies:** Multi-output Neural Networks, SARIMA Models, Geospatial Analysis, Time Series Forecasting

**Context:** Developed during International Potato Center (CIP) Hackathon - Finalist among 50+ international teams
